This repository contains a C++ implementation of a neural network with backpropagation, designed to classify the MNIST dataset.

The Network contains 3 Hidden Layers with Sigmoid Activation Functions and a Softmax Output.

As this was a training project, the only thing the network can do is train as well.

You can find the necessary training/testing Data here: https://github.com/golbin/TensorFlow-MNIST/tree/master/mnist/data

The Data must be in the same directory as the executable.
